## Event Loop
The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that handles the execution of multiple chunks of your program over time. Each chunk is a piece of code that is executed by the JavaScript engine, which could be a function, a callback, or an event handler. The event loop allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.

## JavaScript Threading

JavaScript is single-threaded, which means it processes one operation at a time in a single sequence, or thread, of execution. However, JavaScript can appear to be multi-threaded due to its asynchronous non-blocking behavior, enabled by the event loop and APIs provided by the browser or Node.js.

## Runtime Errors

A runtime error is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. In JavaScript, runtime errors can be caused by a variety of reasons such as type mismatches, reference errors, range errors, etc.
